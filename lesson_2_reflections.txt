What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a dir .get is created, which contains the metadata for the new repository consisting of all files and subfolders where git was initialized.
It may be needed to iniitialze a repository if there is a new dir created where we are going to add files or if an existing dir was made but needed to have a revisioning method.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temp directory that has all the files that one wnats to be committed on the next commit.
so it can contain 0,1, or more files
the working dir/repository has all the files in the respository so if a small change is being made on a large set of data
it ould help to use the staging area nad make the commit focused on t what fiels are being edited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding one file to the stagin area at a time, you can create a commit for that file directly.
This way changes and commits can be logically related

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If there were any drastic changes that needed to be made or things that neeeded to be experimented on, a branch could keep all the versions together yet seperate at the same time.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help vizualize branch structure by showing the diverging paths and paretns branches of different branches.. This way one is able to see how different branches are related and when/where the projects had a difference take place.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

When two branches are merged together their commits are merged into the "master" commit. This makes the process actually somewhat more difficult as commits when sorted by date or no longer logically sequential in the same manner s prior to the merger. IN the diagram they are repreented as a 2 branches combinging into a single branch with 2 parent branch.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

The pro's of Git's automatic merging is that is can save time by figuring out what parts of a file can be added without human intervention.
THe con is that it could also merge inputs that cause a conflict that is undetected
The pro of manual merges is that every line of code is vettted by the author, the con is that the author or some human must manually grind though code, which can and does tkake precious coder resource.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

With manual pulls you are getting updates when you want them. If you are alreday working on a commit, and new commits are made remotley, you do not want remote commits to interfere with the local work you are doing. Say you are working with a.js and there are changes to a.js remotely, you dont want that coming in immediatly.
