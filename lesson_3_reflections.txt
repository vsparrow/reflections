When would you want to create a remote repository rathar than having a local repository for all your work?

There are different reasons for having a remote respository rather than storing changes locally only.
One would be for backup purposes, this way there is another copy of your work stored externally from one device/location/site.
Two would be to share the repostory data with others who may not have remote access to your local repostory.
A third reason ofr a remote respotry would be if you dont ahve a local reposotyr because you are working at a site where data is not saved, example, netcafe or using  netbook with no or little storage.
